# Writing an amazing readme file

Have you ever wondered if your project readme is good enough? It is useful for developers? What about non
-developers audience? ðŸ¤” A simple **README** file in your project could be really useful. 

### What's a README file?
Let's start from the begging... Basically, a README is just a text file (`.md` extension) that introduces and explains 
a project. It contains -but is not limited to- information that is commonly required to understand what the project 
is about.

### Why should I make it?
That sounds really nice, but all team and the client already known almost all about the project, so why should I make 
one? Well, it's an easy way to answer questions that your audience will likely have regarding how to install and use 
your project and also how to collaborate with you and definetely it's a great start point for new team members.

### When should I make it?
Definitely before you show a project to other people or make it public. You might want to get into the habit of making 
it the first file you create in a new project. Before to write your first README is strongly recommend to go and read about 
[Readme Driven Development](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) first. 
(**TL;DR:** *first of all write your Readme*)

### Standard Readme Template

A nice readme must include at least the following seccions:

* Project Title
* Table of content (optional)
* About/Background
* Getting Started
	* Installation
* About/Description
	* Usage
* Contributing
* Authors
* License

This is just a basic structure template to write a standard `README` file. According your type of project you should
consider add other section such as `versioning`, `useful commands`, `environmets`, `resources`, `metrics`, `migrations`, 
among others. Remember every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours, but always remember
that all the relevant information about the project should be included in this documentation file.

### Suggestions and Tips

* Too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of 
documentation rather than cutting out information.

* A README is like the face of your project. It is the first file a person should read when encountering a source tree, 
and it should be awesome like your project.

* No README, no description, no nothing. You wonâ€™t get any idea what this guy built, no matter how awesome it is.

* Donâ€™t get lazy, provide examples. 

* A happy thing is to just have screenshots or even video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos) in it 
especially if you have a visual program like a web or mobile app. Just something that grabs interest.

* Let audience know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors 
might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here.

* Provide some kind ok support. Tell audience where they should go to for help. 

* Add credits, inspiration, alternatives, similar tools. 

* Use the README file to track major changes could be useful for maintainance.
